parameter. 

02. Rounding
This function rounds numbers to specific precision. The input comes as two numbers. The first value is the number to be rounded and the

15.Remove trailing zeroes, if any.

03. Division

10. The Pyramid of King Djoser
Write a JS program that calculates how much resources will be required for the construction of a pyramid. It is made out of stone, marble, 
lapis lazuli and gold. Your program will receive an integer that will be the base width and length of the pyramid and an increment, that is the 
height of each step. The bulk is made out of stone, while the outer layer is made out of marble. Every fifth step’s outer layer is made out of 
lapis lazuli instead of marble. The final step is made out of gold.
The pyramid is built with 1x1 blocks with height equal to the given increment. The first step of the pyramid has width and length equal to the 
given base and every next step is reduced by 2 blocks (1 from each side). The height of every step equals the given increment. 
Note the top-most layer is made entirely out of gold, with height equal to the given increment. 

11. Bitcoin "Mining"
Write a JavaScript program that calculates the total amount of bitcoins you purchased with the gold you mined during your shift at the mine. 
Your shift consists of a certain number of days where you mine an amount of gold in grams. Your program will receive an array with the amount 
of gold you mined each day, where the first day of your shift is the first index of the array. Also, someone was stealing every third day from 
the start of your shift 30% from the mined gold for this day. For the different exchanges use these prices: 1 Bitcoin = 11949.16 lv., 
1g of gold = 67.51 lv.
