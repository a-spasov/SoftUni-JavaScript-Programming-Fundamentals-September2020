10. Spice Must Flow
Write a program that calculates the total amount of spice that can be extracted from a source. The source has a starting yield, which indicates
how much spice can be mined on the first day. After it has been mined for a day, the yield drops by 10, meaning on the second day it’ll produce
10 less spice than on the first, on the third day 10 less than on the second, and so on (see examples). A source is considered profitable only 
while its yield is at least 100 – when less than 100 spice is expected in a day, abandon the source. 
The mining crew consumes 26 spice every day at the end of their shift and an additional 26 after the mine has been exhausted. Note that the 
workers cannot consume more spice than there is in storage. 
When the operation is complete, print on the console on two separate lines how many days the mine has operated and the total amount of spice extracted.
