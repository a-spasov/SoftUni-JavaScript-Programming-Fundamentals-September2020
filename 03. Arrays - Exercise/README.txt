01. Add or Subtract
This function changes the value of odd and even numbers in an array of numbers. If the number is even - add to its value its index 
position. If the number is odd - subtract to its value its index position.

02. Common Elements
This function prints common elements in two string arrays on separate lines. 

03. Merge Arrays
This function receives two string arrays and merges them into a third array. If the index of the element is even, it adds into the third
array the sum of both elements at that index. If the index of the element is odd, add the concatenation of both elements at that index.
 
04. Array Rotation
This function receives an array and number of rotations you have to perform (first element goes at the end). 

05. Max Number
This function finds all the top integers in an array. A top integer is an integer which is bigger than all the elements to its right. 

06. Equal Sums
This function determines if there exists an element in the array of numbers such that the sum of the elements on its left is equal to 
the sum of the elements on its right. The function prints the index that satisfies the required condition or "no" if there is no such 
index.

07. Max Sequence of Equal Elements
This function finds the longest sequence of equal elements in an array of numbers. If several longest sequences exist, print 
the leftmost one.
