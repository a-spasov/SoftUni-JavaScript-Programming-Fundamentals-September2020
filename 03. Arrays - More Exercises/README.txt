01. Print N-th Element
This function collects each element of an array, on a given step. The input comes as array of strings. The last element is N - the step.

02. Add and Remove
This function adds and removes numbers to/from an array. You will receive a command which can either be "add" or "remove". 
The initial number is 1. Each input command should increase that number, regardless of what it is. Upon receiving an "add" command you 
should add the current number to your array. Upon receiving the "remove" command you should remove the last entered number, currently 
existent in the array.

03. Rotate Array
This function rotates an array. The array should be rotated to the right side, meaning that the last element should become the first, up
on rotation. The input comes as array of strings. The last element of the array is the amount of rotation you need to perform.

04. Non-Decreasing Subsequence
Write a function that extracts only those numbers that form a non-decreasing subsequence. In other words, you start from the first 
element and continue to the end of the given array of numbers. Any number which is LESS THAN the current biggest one is ignored, 
alternatively if itâ€™s equal or higher than the current biggest one you set it as the current biggest one and you continue to the next 
number.
