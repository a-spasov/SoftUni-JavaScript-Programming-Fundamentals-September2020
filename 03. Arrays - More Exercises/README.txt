01. Print N-th Element
This function collects each element of an array, on a given step. The input comes as array of strings. The last element is N - the step.

02. Add and Remove
Write a function that adds and removes numbers to/from an array. You will receive a command which can either be "add" or "remove". 
The initial number is 1. Each input command should increase that number, regardless of what it is. Upon receiving an "add" command you 
should add the current number to your array. Upon receiving the "remove" command you should remove the last entered number, currently 
existent in the array.
