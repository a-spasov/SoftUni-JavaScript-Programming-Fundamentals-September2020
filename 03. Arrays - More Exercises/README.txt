This function collects each element of an array, on a given step. The input comes as array of strings. The last element is N - the step.

02. Add and Remove
This function adds and removes numbers to/from an array. You will receive a command which can either be "add" or "remove". 
The initial number is 1. Each input command should increase that number, regardless of what it is. Upon receiving an "add" command you

existent in the array.

alternatively if itâ€™s equal or higher than the current biggest one you set it as the current biggest one and you continue to the next 
number.
