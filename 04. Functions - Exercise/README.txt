01. Smallest of Three Numbers
This function receives three integer numbers and prints the smallest. 

02. Add and Subtract
You will receive three integer numbers. Write a function sum() to get the sum of the first two integers and subtract() function that 
subtracts the third integer from the result.

03. Characters in Range
Write a function that receives two characters and prints on a single line all the characters in between them according to the ASCII 
code. Keep in mind that the second character code might be before the first one inside the ASCII table.

04. Odd and Even Sum
This function returns the sum of all even and all odd digits from given number. 

05. Palindrome Integers
A palindrome is a number which reads the same backward as forward, such as 323 or 1001. Write a function which receives an array of 
positive integer and checks if each integer is a palindrome or not.

06. Password Validator
This function checks if a given password is valid. Password validations are: the length should be 6 - 10 characters (inclusive); it 
should consists only of letters and digits; it should have at least 2 digits. If a password is valid print "Password is valid".
If it is NOT valid, for every unfulfilled rule function prints a message.

07. NxN Matrix
This function receives a single integer number n and prints nxn matrix with that number.

08. Perfect Number 
Write a function that receive a number and return if this number is perfect or NOT. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal
to the sum of its proper positive divisors. That is the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its 
aliquot sum).

09. Loading Bar
You will receive a single number between 0 and 100 which is divided with 10 without residue (0, 10, 20, 30...). Your task is to create a
function that visualize a loading bar depending on that number you have received in the input.

10. Factorial Division
Write a function that receives two integer numbers. Calculate factorial of each number. Divide the first result by the second and print
the division formatted to the second decimal point.
