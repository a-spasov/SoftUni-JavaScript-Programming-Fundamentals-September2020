03. Characters in Range
Write a function that receives two characters and prints on a single line all the characters in between them according to the ASCII 
code. Keep in mind that the second character code might be before the first one inside the ASCII table.

04. Odd and Even Sum

05. Palindrome Integers
A palindrome is a number which reads the same backward as forward, such as 323 or 1001. Write a function which receives an array of 
positive integer and checks if each integer is a palindrome or not.

06. Password Validator
