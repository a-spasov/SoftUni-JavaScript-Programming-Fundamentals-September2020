01. Train
You will be given an array of strings.
The first element will be a string containing wagons (numbers). Each number inside the string represents the number of passengers that 
are currently in a wagon. The second element in the array will be the max capacity of each wagon (single number). The rest of the 
elements will be commands in the following format:
•	Add {passengers} – add a wagon to the end with the given number of passengers.
•	{passengers} -  find an existing wagon to fit all the passengers (starting from the first wagon)
At the end print the final state of the train (all the wagons separated by a space)

02. Distinct Array
You will be given an array of integer numbers on the first line of the input (space-separated). Remove all repeating elements from the 
array. Print the result elements separated by single space.

03.	House Party
Write a function that keeps track of guests that are going to a house party.
You will be given an array of strings. Each string will be one of the following:
-	"{name} is going!"
-	"{name} is not going!"
If you receive the first type of input, you have to add the person if he/she is not in the list (If he/she is in the list print: 
"{name} is already in the list!").
If you receive the second type of input, you have to remove the person if he/she is in the list (if not print: "{name} is not in the 
list!"). At the end print all the guests each on a separate line.

04.	Sorting
Write a function that sorts an array of numbers so that the first element is the biggest one, the second is the smallest one, the third
is the second biggest one, the fourth is the second smallest one and so on. 
Print the elements on one row, separated by single space.
