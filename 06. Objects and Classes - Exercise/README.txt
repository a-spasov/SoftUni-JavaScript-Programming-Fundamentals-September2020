01. Employees
You're tasked to create a list of employees and their personal numbers. You will receive an array of strings. Each string is an 
employee name and to assign them a personal number you have to find the length of the name (whitespace included). Try to use an object.
At the end print all the list employees in the following format: "Name: {employeeName} -- Personal Number: {personalNum}" .

02. Towns
Youâ€™re tasked to create and print objects from a text table. You will receive input as an array of strings, where each string represents
a row of a table, with values on the row separated by pipes "|" and spaces. The table will consist of exactly 3 columns "Town", 
"Latitude" and "Longitude". The latitude and longitude columns will always contain valid numbers. The output should be objects. Latitude
and longitude must be parsed to numbers and formatted to the second decimal point!
